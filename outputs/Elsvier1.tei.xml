<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, various fully supervised learning methods are successfully applied for lung CT image segmentation. However, pixel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and labor-intensive, but the performance of unsupervised learning methods are failed to meet the demands of practical applications. To achieve a reasonable trade-off between the performance and label dependency, a novel weakly supervised inpaintingbased learning method is introduced, in which only bounding box labels are required for accurate segmentation. Specifically, lesion regions are first detected by an object detection network, then we crop them out of the input image and recover the missing holes to normal regions using a progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN). Finally, a post-processing method is designed to get the accurate segmentation mask from the difference image of input and recovered images. In addition, real information (i.e., number, location and size) of the bounding boxes of lesions from the dataset guides us to make the training dataset for PCIN. We apply a multi-scale supervised strategy to train PCIN for a progressive and stable inpainting. Moreover, to remove the visual artifacts resulted from the invalid features of missing holes, an initial patch generation network (IPGN) is proposed for holes initialization with generated pseudo healthy image patches. Experiments on the public COVID-19 dataset demonstrate that PCIN is outstanding in lung CT images inpainting, and the performance of our proposed weakly supervised method is comparable to fully supervised methods.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>According to the latest statistics from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) of Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (updated <ref type="bibr" coords="1,37.59,513.20,61.39,7.43">March 10, 2023)</ref>, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world have reached 676.6 million, including 6.88 million deaths. Recently, with the wide spread of Omicron mutant in the world, the epidemic has rebounded in many countries and newly confirmed cases per day have reached a new high.</p><p>Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the diagnostic benchmark for COVID-19, it suffers from many limitation such as short in supply, high false-negative rates and higher cost equipment <ref type="bibr" coords="1,164.57,598.06,10.09,7.43" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Chest computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients have unique characteristics, which show multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, mainly in the peripheral lungs at the early stage and then multiple groundglass opaque (GGO) infiltrates in both lungs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,199.58,640.49,10.09,7.43" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Clinical practice has of these methods is considered directly proportional to the scale and accuracy of the required dataset. It should be noted that annotation of pixel-level labels is a labor-intensive process and suffers from a high cost and uneven quality. Although the unsupervised learning methods are label-free, their performance fail to meet the demands of practical applications. Semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods are able to achieve a trade-off between the performance and label dependency, however, few related researches exist.</p><p>Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic segmentation, can be divided into image-level label-based, bounding box label-based, scribble label-based and points label-based according to the way of annotation. Image-level labels only provide the category of an image, so image-level label-based methods first train a classification model, then employ Class Activation Maps (CAM) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.39,368.75,11.23,7.43" target="#b5">[6]</ref> technology to obtain the most responsive regions from the model as seed regions, finally perform a series of expansion methods to obtain the segmentation mask. Because CAM are unable to cover the entire target, it requires a high performance of the post-processing steps to ensure final segmentation. The bounding boxes are the representations of objects position, so bounding box label-based methods treat it as a strong topological prior, then combine traditional image algorithm GrabCut <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.39,442.29,11.23,7.43" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or its improved trainable version DeepCut <ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.11,452.80,10.09,7.43" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Scribble labels refer to marking the target with scribble lines to get the rough location information. Scribble labelbased methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,95.75,473.81,11.22,7.43" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,106.97,473.81,11.22,7.43" target="#b9">10]</ref> are extension of DeepCut, which incorporate deep features in constructing the unary part of the loss function. Points labels indicate the object location using single or few pixels. Points label-based method <ref type="bibr" coords="2,107.98,505.33,15.72,7.43" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is prone to local minima, e.g., focusing on only a small part of the target. Therefore, objectness prior is included in the training loss function to accurately infer the object extent. These four methods have achieved passable results on public datasets such as MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. All other weakly label-based methods except bounding box label-based methods have been applied for COVID-19 lesion segmentation.</p><p>To reduce the dependence on pixel-level labels, in this paper, we explore a novel weakly supervised inpainting-based learning method for COVID-19 lesion segmentation, in which only bounding box labels are required for training. Different from the general practice, our proposed method consists of three stages: detection, inpainting and segmentation. In the first stage, the bounding boxes of lesions are detected by the state-of-the-art object detection network Faster RCNN <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.49,652.51,14.36,7.43" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the second stage, we crop the detected lesion regions out of the image and recover the missing holes to normal regions using image inpainting technology. In the third stage, the segmentation mask is obtained from the difference image between the input and recovered images through a series of post-processing operations 1 We did not overlay the results with the region of no missing to comprehensively demonstrate our inpainting effect. including median filtering, binarization, dilation and region growing. For a better image inpainting, our proposed progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN) decouples the recovery of high-frequency and lowfrequency information. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,461.32,263.59,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, PCIN first recovers the missing skeleton (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,384.99,274.10,10.74,7.43" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>)) using structure inpainting branch, and then utilizes the comprehensive inpainting branch for a reasonable complete result (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,347.84,295.11,10.31,7.43" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>)) generation. To solve the issue that invalid features of the holes lead to color discrepancy and blurriness, we propose an initial patch generation network (IPGN) to generate pseudo healthy image patches for holes initialization. In addition, we supervise the recovery effect at multiple scales during training period for a progressive and stable inpainting.</p><p>Our contributions are summarized as follows:</p><p>1. We propose a weakly supervised inpainting-based learning method for COVID-19 lesion segmentation from lung CT images, in which only bounding box labels are required and three stages: detection, inpainting and segmentation are included. 2. A progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN) is proposed to recover lung CT images with rectangle missing holes, which first uses structure inpainting branch to recover the skeleton, and then fuses deep structure features to comprehensive inpainting branch for a reasonable complete result generation. 3. A multi-scale supervised strategy is applied to train PCIN for a progressive and stable inpainting. In addition, to remove the visual artifacts resulted from the invalid features of missing holes, an initial patch generation network (IPGN) is proposed to generate pseudo healthy image patches for holes initialization. 4. Experiments on public COVID-19 dataset demonstrate that PCIN is outstanding in CT images inpainting, and the performance of our proposed weakly supervised method is comparable to fully supervised methods.</p></div>

UNet and its improvement networks (UNet++ <ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.48,682.06,14.36,7.43" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, VNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,484.72,682.06,14.36,7.43" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, etc.) or UNetlike networks are also widely used for COVID-19 lesion segmentation because of their excellent performance. Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,495.32,703.07,11.23,7.43" target="#b2">[3]</ref> used original UNet to segment the COVID-19 lesion from CT images. Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,546.46,713.58,11.23,7.43" target="#b4">[5]</ref> used UNet++ for lesion segmentation. To improve the segmentation performance, Yan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.56,734.59,15.72,7.43" target="#b15">[16]</ref> combined the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to UNet to increase the receptive fields of network as well as improve the ability of multi-scale contexts acquirement. Fully supervised methods work well but rely on large-scale accurate pixel-level label datasets, whereas only small-scale datasets are available for researchers. To achieve comparable performance, multi-input and multi-scale inputs are used to adequately extract image features and perform feature fusion. In addition, researches on improving the loss function are also presented. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,206.98,129.13,15.72,7.43" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a noise robust Dice loss function, which solves the problem of poor training performance with low quality and high noise labels. To address the overfitting caused by millions of model parameters, Anam-Net <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.95,160.45,15.72,7.43" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and MiniSeg <ref type="bibr" coords="3,85.93,170.89,15.72,7.43" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are proposed, which also promote the deployment of models on embedded devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Weakly supervised learning methods</head><p>Statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="3,84.15,212.63,15.72,7.43" target="#b10">[11]</ref> show that making the accurate pixel-level segmentation labels is so labor-intensive that it takes 239.0 s per image on average for the PASCAL VOC dataset, whereas collecting image-level and point-level labels takes only 20.0 and 22.1 s per image. Hence, different forms of weaker labels are applied for lesion segmentation, including image-level, bounding boxes-level, scribble-level and pointlevel annotations. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,145.48,275.27,15.72,7.43" target="#b19">[20]</ref> first inferred some candidate lesion regions as seeds from classification model trained from image-level labels by applying CAM method, then performed a series of expansion methods to obtain the segmentation mask. However, CAM only focuses on the most discernible regions but not covers the entire target, which requires a high performance of the post-processing algorithm to ensure the segmentation result. Liu <ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.05,337.91,15.72,7.43" target="#b20">[21]</ref> trained a COVID-19 lesion segmentation model using scribble-level labels. To deal with the difficulty caused by the shortage of supervision, he incorporated uncertainty-aware selfensembling and transformation-consistent techniques. Point-level labels contain little supervised information and thus are most difficult to be exploit. To resolve the low precision of the model, Laradji et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.96,390.12,15.72,7.43" target="#b21">[22]</ref> proposed a consistency-based loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input CT images. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose a weakly supervised learning method for COVID-19 lesion segmentation using bounding boxes-level labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Semi-supervised learning methods</head><p>The missing Labels of some images in the dataset result that networks fail to calculate their losses in training period, so semi-supervised methods focus on how to get the unlabeled image into training. Currently, two types of solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, including consistent regularization and self-training using pseudo labels. The first type of solutions follows the assumption that the inputs under different perturbations would be predicted the same result. Thus, we are able to apply perturbations like noise, rotation and scaling to input CT images, or apply perturbations like dropout to networks, then encourage networks to be transformation consistent for unlabeled images. Ding et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,114.67,578.01,15.72,7.43" target="#b22">[23]</ref> applied this strategy to COVID-19 lesion segmentation. The second type of solutions first obtains the pseudo labels for unlabeled CT images from the model trained from labeled CT images. Pseudo labels are then used to supervise the unlabeled CT images in training period. Training dataset are gradually enlarged by unlabeled images with reliable pseudo labels. Meanwhile, the model results and pseudo labels gradually become more accurate. Fan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.96,640.66,15.72,7.43" target="#b23">[24]</ref> applied this strategy for COVID-19 lesion segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Unsupervised learning methods</head><p>Unsupervised methods are currently popular, which completely abandon the label dependency although their performance is far inferior to fully supervised methods. Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,218.91,703.27,11.23,7.43" target="#b3">[4]</ref> performed segmentation on blood vessels and inpainting blood vessels to normal tissue, then segmented the lesion using representation learning and clustering <ref type="bibr" coords="3,76.49,734.59,14.36,7.43" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Average NMI score of this method is 0.394 but it is so time-consuming that segmenting one CT case needs over three hours. Some methods <ref type="bibr" coords="3,391.02,66.21,15.38,7.43" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,406.40,66.21,11.54,7.43" target="#b26">27]</ref> applied auto-encoder to learn latent feature from CT images with lesion, and then recovered the images to health, finally obtained the segmentation results by post-processing the images before and after recover. Inspired by these works, we propose a two-branch auto-encoder network, i.e., PCIN for CT image inpainting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Image inpainting</head><p>Image inpainting, a technology used to fill in missing regions with plausible alternative contents, is widely used in repairing mask with different shape, target removal, denoising, removing watermark and coloring of old photos <ref type="bibr" coords="3,374.71,177.11,14.36,7.43" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Image inpainting methods can be grouped into traditional methods and learning-based methods. Traditional patchbased methods <ref type="bibr" coords="3,363.16,197.44,15.38,7.43" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,378.54,197.44,11.54,7.43" target="#b30">30]</ref> fill large holes by searching for the most relevant patches from the complete part of a group of images. Traditional diffusion-based method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,391.13,217.76,15.72,7.43" target="#b31">[31]</ref> smoothly propagates information from the boundary of the missing holes to the interior with variational algorithms. Traditional methods are able to solve the inpainting task with small area, simple structure and texture of the missing region. However, for more complex image inpainting task, learning-based methods have more advantages because of their understanding and perception of high-level semantic information of images. Learning-based methods use generative models such as VAE <ref type="bibr" coords="3,418.28,288.91,15.72,7.43" target="#b32">[32]</ref> and GAN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,470.39,288.91,15.72,7.43" target="#b33">[33]</ref> for inpainting. Context encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="3,353.66,299.07,15.72,7.43" target="#b34">[34]</ref> is the first work to combined auto-encoder network with adversarial training for image inpainting. It generates complete image from semantic features extracted from auto-encoder network and supervises with the pixel-wise reconstruction loss and adversarial loss. The introduction of reconstruction loss makes the inpainting result more realistic but has problems with boundary distortion and local blurring. To solve this problem, Iizuka et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,470.05,360.05,15.72,7.43" target="#b35">[35]</ref> added a global discriminator that performed on the whole image region to work with the local discriminator. Local and global structural semantic information drives boundaries of recovered holes to be more continuous.</p><p>In addition, many meaningful improvements have emerged. To address that invalid features of missing holes produce artifacts such as color difference and blur when standard convolution networks are used for image inpainting, Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.86,431.19,15.72,7.43" target="#b36">[36]</ref> proposed Partial Convolution and Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.09,441.35,15.72,7.43" target="#b37">[37]</ref> proposed Gate Convolution.

In order to improve the inpainting effect on images with large holes, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,457.98,471.84,15.72,7.43" target="#b39">[39]</ref> proposed a Progressive Reconstruction of Visual Structure (PRVS) network that progressively reconstructs the structures and the associated visual feature, in which a novel Visual Structure Reconstruction (VSR) layer is proposed to entangle reconstructions of the visual structure and visual feature. Nazeri et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.33,522.66,15.72,7.43" target="#b40">[40]</ref> proposed EdgeConnect, which imitates sketch art and divides inpainting process into a two-stages: edge generation and image completion. Predicted edge maps from the first stage are passed to the second stage to guide the inpainting process. This method has ability to deal with images with multiple, irregularly shaped missing regions.</p><p>In the field of medical image, inspired by EdgeConnect, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,327.35,583.63,15.72,7.43" target="#b41">[41]</ref> proposed a model based on edge and structure information for CT images inpainting, which utilizes both edge and structure images as priors of the ground truth. It achieves the best performance on several public CT datasets.

Faster RCNN <ref type="bibr" coords="4,403.19,660.38,15.72,7.43" target="#b42">[42]</ref> consists of three main modules: extractor, region proposal network(RPN) and classifier. VGG-16 model with a pre-trained weights from ImageNet is used as a deep features extractor. The obtained feature maps are shared with subsequent modules. RPN is a major innovation of Faster RCNN, it is used to replace the extremely time-consuming selective search algorithm in Fast RCNN to generate region proposals. Specifically, a sliding window (3x3 convolution layer) slides over the shared feature maps to get intermediate feature maps, F. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,45.31,36.65,23.45,5.92">Lu et al.</ref> in which each point is the deep low-dimensional information mapped from the anchor boxes with different sizes and ratios on the input CT image. Then, a 1x1 convolution layer judges whether anchor contains objects and another 1x1 convolution layer predicts the position of anchors. Next, these rough region proposals are mapped back to shared feature maps and cropped out to get a proposal feature maps. Finally, in the classifier, RoI pooling resizes the proposal feature maps to the same size and feeds them into several full connect layers to get the final anchors location and class. In this work, we used a total of 9 anchors including three different scales and aspect ratios for each point based on the distribution of lesion size in our dataset. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,222.11,160.74,4.49,7.43" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the initial setting of anchors, where base size is the datum scale of the anchor size.

As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,208.86,682.25,3.36,7.43">4</ref>, SEM is composed of a series of image processing steps. First, a median filter with kernel size 7 × 7 is applied to smooth the images and further reduce noise, which is mainly tiny blood vessel tissue. Second, skeleton in the CT image is automatic segmented by OTSU <ref type="bibr" coords="5,150.89,724.12,15.71,7.43" target="#b43">[43]</ref> method.

Forth, we select the maximum connected region and obtain the final structure information including structure and contour by filling and stroking. It is noted that missing holes of the image are filled with a pixel value of 0 during extraction process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Initial patch generation network (IPGN)</head><p>Standard convolution indiscriminately treats all pixels including missing holes as valid pixels that imply semantic information, which has been experimentally shown to result visual artifacts, color differences, etc. Initializing a fixed pixel value for the missing holes has limited improvements. Two effective methods, Partial Convolution and Gate Convolution, take the additional maintenance of a mask to filter out invalid content for standard convolutions. However, as the network deepens, this ability to discriminate whether a pixel is valid or invalid gradually decreases. In this work, IPGN is proposed to generate pseudo healthy image patches to initialize the missing holes. This method reduces the invalidity of pixels in the missing holes and does not increase the burden of inpainting network. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,529.68,244.71,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, IPGN uses a 2D random noise of 25 × 25 as input to generate a fake image of 100 × 100. Three types of convolution block are designed for IPGN and the details of PCIN are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,465.39,276.12,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Instance normalization (IN) in CB-A and CB-B can accelerate model convergence and promote style consistency between generated images and real images, so six CB-A are used for feature extraction. Two transposed convolution layers instead of up-sampling layers are used to expand the image size because it works well in image reconstruction from reduced representations, i.e. noise. In order to generate more realistic images, we construct a discriminator to train IPGN utilizing an adversarial loss base on GAN. The discriminator uses one CB-A and five CB-B for feature extraction. Five max pooling layers gradually increase the receptive field of the network while decreasing the size of feature maps. Finally, the classification result is given by the fully connected layer.</p><p>In conclusion, IPGN serves as a generator to learn the data distribution from a random noise, and a discriminator learns to distinguish between the fake output and the real image, hence the adversarial loss for IPGN,  𝑖𝑝𝑔𝑛 , is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,306.60,449.88,251.08,27.17"> 𝑖𝑝𝑔𝑛 = min 𝑓 𝑖𝑝𝑔𝑛 max 𝐷 E 𝑥∼ [𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐷(𝑥))] +E 𝑧∼ [𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 − 𝐷(𝑓 𝑖𝑝𝑔𝑛 (𝑧)))]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝐷 represents discriminator,  and  represent distribution of real images  𝑔 and noise 𝑧, respectively. Some fake images generated by IPGN are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,409.06,504.05,3.36,7.43" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, we observe that the lung parenchyma is realistic but the skeleton is easily distinguished as fake by human eyes. Deformed and disordered skeleton will be further recovered by our proposed inpainting network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">Progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN)</head><p>Considering that recovery of skeleton in the missing holes is critical for subsequent segmentation, a separate branch is designed in PCIN to recover skeleton. To our best knowledge, EdgeConnect <ref type="bibr" coords="5,524.08,587.99,15.72,7.43" target="#b40">[40]</ref> first divided the image inpainting process into a two-stages: edge generation and image completion, in which edge generation is solely focused on edges of the missing holes. EdgeConnect enlightens from how artists work, i.e., ''lines first, color next''. However, this method is not applicable to chest CT images that with simple edge information. On this basis, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,392.32,650.82,15.72,7.43" target="#b41">[41]</ref> utilized both edge and structure images as priors of the ground truth for CT images inpainting. However, this structural information retains pulmonary parenchymal features, but results in poor skeleton recovery in his results. To address this problem, we extract pure structure (i.e. skeleton) and contour information from the input CT image using SEM, and then decouple the recovery of skeleton from the overall recovery through a single network which called structure inpainting branch.

However, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,421.39,536.29,22.02,7.43" target="#fig_12">11 (b)</ref>, 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 is not sensitive to IoU threshold before 0.8. To make trade-off between 𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 and 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙, the IoU threshold is set to 0.8, and the corresponding 𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 and 𝐴𝑃 are 0.62, 0.70 and 0.66, respectively. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,489.05,567.60,8.97,7.43" target="#fig_13">12</ref> shows detection results of three lung CT images, in which the IoU of all bounding boxes and the labeled ground truth are greater than 0.9.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">Quantitative results</head><p>We quantitatively compare our proposed PCIN with four representative state-of-the-art image inpainting methods: EC, CA, PC and GC. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,345.15,661.52,4.49,7.43" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows the overall performance comparison. It is obvious that PCIN has the best performance. The performance of existing four methods differs greatly, among which CA is the best one with 𝑀𝐴𝐸 of 49.89, 𝑃 𝑆𝑁𝑅 of 12.01 and 𝑆𝑆𝐼𝑀 of 0.1784. Relatively good results of CA verify that encoder-decoder structure and reconstructionadversarial joint loss are useful for image inpainting. PCIN adopts the encoder-decoder structure but gives up using the adversarial loss because it is difficult to converge when training. In summary, PCIN     <ref type="table" coords="10,236.41,639.45,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, it is obvious that experimental results are consistent with our suppose. Our method is at least 3.6 points of 𝑃 𝑆𝑁𝑅 higher than methods initialized with constants. Additionally, an interesting phenomenon is observed that the smaller the initial value, the better the inpainting performance. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,71.02,692.39,4.49,7.43" target="#tab_6">5</ref> shows the performance comparison on different holes ratios. We observe that existing methods show better inpainting performance for small-area missing holes but the performance decays severely as the missing area increases. Instead, Our method is not only superior in performance, but also stable on different holes ratios. Empirically, skeleton part dominates the overall inpainting effect for large holes. The prior knowledge provided by the structure inpainting branch ensures a stable inpainting performance of 𝑃 𝐶𝐼𝑁.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.">Qualitative results</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,336.39,597.87,8.97,7.43" target="#fig_15">13</ref> illustrates the visual results of PCIN and existing four methods (EC, CA, PC and GC). Results show that our method generates most reasonable and realistic content. Results of the existing four methods are easily identified as fake due to the disparity errors and visual artifacts such as color leakage, blurring discontinuity and the partial occlusion. EC and GC incorrectly recover the lung parenchyma of missing holes to skeleton and the results of GC are more blur. On the contrary, PC recovers the lung parenchyma of missing holes to skeleton, with an appearance of peeling. This is because the mask of partial convolution network gradually disappears in the deeper layer, which forces the network to make ambiguity decision when training. CA achieves relatively good results but exists serious checkerboard artifacts caused by deconvolution layers. In summary, PCIN applies structure inpainting branch for skeleton recovery, and then fuses deep   structure features to comprehensive inpainting branch for a reasonable complete result generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Segmentation results</head><p>To compare the lesion segmentation performance with fully supervised methods, we consider three state-of-the-art medical image segmentation networks (i.e., UNet, Attention-UNet and SegNet) and five recently proposed COVID-19 lesion segmentation networks (i.e., JCS, COVID-rate, AnamNet, MiniSeg and InfNet). The number of parameters, FLOPs, and baseline are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,182.60,578.81,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. We can clearly see that the numbers of parameters and FLOPs of IPGN and PCIN are at a moderate level compared to these fully supervised models. Quantitative results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,112.33,609.97,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_8">7</ref>, our method outperforms SegNet and UNet in terms of 𝐷𝑆𝐶, and is comparable to Attention-UNet. The 𝐷𝑆𝐶 of our method is only 7.54% lower than that of the best performing network InfNet. The 𝑆𝐸𝑁 is defined as the proportion of true-positive (TP) pixels in the predicted image, which is considered more important compared to other metrics in medical image segmentation. Our threestage method is a process from coarse to fine, covering more possible lesion regions in the detection stage, hence results an excellent 𝑆𝐸𝑁 below InfNet and COVID-Rate. GrabCut is a semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm based on graph cut. It requires the user to input a bounding box as the segmentation target area, enabling the segmentation of the object from the background. Our method outperforms GrabCut in terms of 𝐷𝑆𝐶, 𝐼𝑜𝑈 and 𝑆𝐸𝑁. The 𝑆𝐸𝑁 metric surpasses GrabCut by 39.34%. We have achieved such a significant improvement compared to GrabCut because GrabCut does not effectively separate the lesions from the background.</p><p>To analyze the impact of inpainting quality on segmentation results, we compared our PCIN method with six different inpainting algorithms: EC, CA, GC, PC, Fast Marching and Navier-Stokes. Among these, Fast Marching and Navier-Stokes are lightweight diffusion-based inpainting methods. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,408.61,389.70,3.36,7.43" target="#tab_9">8</ref>, when the inpainting results of PCIN are directly subtracted from the original image to obtain the segmentation results without using post-processing, we achieved the best Dice score of 74.28%, which is 1.75% higher than the second-ranking EC method. The IoU metric also yielded the best result at 68.22%, surpassing the EC method by 2.31%. After applying the post-processing, our method shows a 4.06% improvement in 𝐷𝑆𝐶, a 2.6% improvement in 𝐼𝑜𝑈 , and a 5.06% improvement in 𝑆𝐸𝑁. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the post-processing method in enhancing the segmentation outcomes. Among the two lightweight restoration methods, Navier-Stokes exhibits the best performance, with the smallest difference compared to the deep learning restoration method PC. It shows a difference of 0.71% in 𝐷𝑆𝐶, 0.67% in 𝐼𝑜𝑈 , and 1.2% in 𝑆𝐸𝑁.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,336.05,525.58,8.97,7.43" target="#fig_16">14</ref> illustrates the visual comparison of lesion segmentation results between five recently proposed COVID-19 lesion segmentation networks and our method. As can be seen, results of InfNet and JCS are closest to the ground truth. MiniSeg performs also excellent but has many false positive pixels in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,424.14,567.39,18.08,7.43" target="#fig_16">14(d)</ref>. The segmentation performance of COVID-rate and AnamNet for lesion with small area (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,539.11,577.85,14.86,7.43;11,306.60,588.30,3.24,7.43" target="#fig_16">14(ac</ref>)) is better than that for lesion with big area (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,495.72,588.30,20.76,7.43" target="#fig_16">14(d-e</ref>)). Instead, our method is relatively stable and with less false positive pixels than COVID-rate and AnamNet. In addition, results of Figs. <ref type="figure" coords="11,501.10,609.20,15.22,7.43" target="#fig_16">14(a</ref>) and 14(b) show that our method outperforms most other methods. In summary, our proposed weakly supervised method achieves a comparable segmentation performance to fully supervised methods using cost effective bounding box labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised inpainting-based method for lung CT images segmentation, in which only cost effective bounding box labels are required for training. Our method is a coarse to fine process consisting of three stages: detection, inpainting and segmentation. Detected lesion regions from detection stage are first   cropped out of the input image, then the missing holes are recovered to normal regions by progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN), finally the accurate segmentation mask is obtained by a post-process method from the difference image of input and recovered images. In order to remove the visual artifacts resulted from the invalid features of missing holes, we also propose a patch generation network (IPGN) for holes initialization with generated pseudo healthy image patches. Experiments on public COVID-19 dataset verify the effectiveness of our methods. Moreover, our method achieves comparable segmentation performance to some models trained using fully supervised labels. It strikes a good balance between label marking cost and segmentation accuracy.</p><p>Although our proposed method is comparable to fully supervised methods, we also have some challenges. First, our method is not onestep, which contains three learnable models (Faster RCNN, IPGN and PCIN), so the training process of the model is relatively complex. Second, segmentation performance is prone to be affected by the preceding two stages. During the detection phase, false positive results have minimal impact on segmentation performance because the regions falsely identified as positive are restored to healthy regions during the hole-filling process. However, false negative results can significantly decrease segmentation performance as the missing lesion regions do not participate in subsequent stages, and this impact is irreversible. In the inpainting phase, the proposed inpainting method in this paper does not generate non-existing tissues, thus it has minimal effect on segmentation performance. Third, the edge of segmentation results from our method is rough and has a few gaps. In future work, we will try to design a network to perform both detection and inpainting tasks, and the performance of post-processing will be further optimized.</p></div>
